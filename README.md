# Data-Feed

Data-Feed is a fully functional, real-time content aggregator built using [Angular](http://www.angularjs.org) and [Firebase](http://www.firebase.com) using no back-end server.

It contains a fully functional client in the app/ directory, and a service that parses RSS data and pushes it into Firebase in the service/ directory.
