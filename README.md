# Data-Feed 

Data-Feed is a real-time content aggregator built using [Angular](http://www.angularjs.org) and [Firebase](http://www.firebase.com) using no back-end server.

It contains a functional client and a service that parses RSS data and pushes it into Firebase. Data is then retreived from Firebase as needed depending on the user and the users settings.
